# Etienne Trédan Finance Code
This repository brings together different codes written in MATLAB and Python, focusing on examples and applications in quantitative finance. The projects were developed while studying financial mathematics and exploring numerical methods for option pricing and stochastic processes.

The content includes:
- Implementations of option pricing models such as European and Asian options, using Monte Carlo simulations and discretized stochastic processes.
- Small programs illustrating key results from stochastic calculus, including Itô’s lemma, quadratic variation, and martingale properties.
- Visualization scripts that generate payoff curves, price vs. initial spot plots, and 3D pricing surfaces to better understand model behaviour.

A mix of codes in MATLAB, which is well suited for numerical simulations and matrix-based computations, and in Python, which is useful for flexibility, data manipulation, and possible extensions toward broader applications.

The goal of this repository is to share clean and reusable examples showing how theoretical concepts in finance can be implemented step by step in practice. Each script is kept straightforward and documented to make the link between the mathematical formulas and the computational results clear.
